                <h1>Egor Frygin</h1>
                <h2>Full Stack & Software <span class = "highlight">Developer</span></h2>
                <p>
                    Graduate of a mechanical engineering degree program, but incredibly passionate about coding. Programming became one of the only available sources of income during the pandemic 2020 and turned out to be a very exciting spare-time activity. This is when I gained the most valuable experience in the domain of IT as well as the greatest motivation to delve into the subject even further. 
                    <br>
